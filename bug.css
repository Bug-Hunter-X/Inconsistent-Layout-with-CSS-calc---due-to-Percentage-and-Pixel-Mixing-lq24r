The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results when dealing with percentages and other units simultaneously, especially within nested calculations. For instance, attempting to calculate a width based on a percentage of the parent container and then subtracting a fixed pixel value might not behave as expected across different viewport sizes or parent element dimensions.  The browser's interpretation of the units and the order of operations can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug inconsistencies.
