Instead of directly subtracting pixels from a percentage-based width, calculate the pixel value based on the percentage first, then use a separate CSS declaration for the margin or padding. This ensures consistent results regardless of the parent element's size. For example:

```css
.container {
  width: 80%;
}

.element {
  width: calc(80% - 20px);
  /* Problematic approach */
}

/* Solution */
.element {
  width: 80%;
  margin-left: 20px;
  /* Or use padding-left as needed */
}
```
By separating the percentage-based width and the pixel-based adjustment, we avoid the complexities and potential inconsistencies introduced by nested calculations in `calc()`.
